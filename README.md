# Password-Generator
The password generator is a useful tool for creating strong passwords that are difficult to crack. It can be used to generate passwords for online accounts, email addresses, and other sensitive information
This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords. The first character of the password is always an alphabet character, and the remaining characters are a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and symbols.

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the script (`passwordGenerator2.py`).
4. Run the script using the following command:

   ```bash
   python passwordGenerator2.py
   ```

5. You will be prompted to enter the desired password length.
6. The script will generate a password with the specified length, where the first character is an alphabet character.
